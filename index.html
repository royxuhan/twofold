					<p class="intro">
						Hi there, Welcome to TwoFold!
						<br />
						<br />
						TwoFold is a project started at Carnegie Mellon University by four students - Jack, Roxanne,
						Roy, and Lanna.
						<br />
						<br />
						We came together because we had a shared vision for a dating app that is built for people who
						value long-term relationships.
						<br />
						<br />
						In a time of hooking up and casual dating, we want to challenge the societal expectation of
						online dating, that is often seen as insincere and phsical.
						<br />
						<br />
						All in all, we want to make online dating meaningful and impactful, and TwoFold does just that.
					</p>

					<h3>Where we started...</h3>
					<p>
						To get started with validating our idea, we began with a series of interviews with college
						students and young adults, who are TwoFold's target customers. We also constructed a persona
						based on our target demographics.
						<br />
						<br />
						Our user research involved surveying on general sentiments about online dating, as well as
						specific questions for those who have existing dating apps on the features they'd like to see.
						<br />
						<br />
						In addition, we performed a SET analysis to identify if there is a product opportunity gap in
						the online dating market. We also performed a PESTLE analysis and competitor analysis to further
						valiadte our idea.

					<h3>What we learned</h3>
					<p>
						Through our research and user interviews, we found a series of opportunites in the online dating
						market.
						<br />
						<br />
						Insight #1, most young adults who were interviewed ranked personality and values over looks.
						<br />
						<br />
						Insight #2, People had varied experience with different dating apps but most did not like Tinder
						- an app that prioritizes looks.
						<br />
						<br />
						Insight #3, People prefer a comforting setting when talking to strangers.
						<br />
						<br />
						Insight #4, The quality of conversations goes down with more number of matches.
						<br />
						<br />
						Insight #5, An engaging conversation is one that each party responds promptly to a topic of
						mutual interest.

					<h3>‚ùì Why does it matter?</h3>
					<p>
						Online dating is a huge industry, currently valued at over $12 billion. As a matter of fact,
						over 40% of Americans have used dating apps at some point in their lives.
						<br />
						<br />
						Despite the huge market, online dating industry is far from mature. According to eharmony, 45%
						of users who have used dating apps cliam the apps "left them feeling more frustrated than
						hopeful".

					<h3>Pivoting</h3>
					<p>
						After constructing an MVP of our vision and pitching it to our fellow classmates, we realized
						that our initial goal of building long-term relationships is a viable idea, but it can be tricky
						to implement.
						<br />
						<br />
						Our initial idea was to have dating coashes and smart algorithms to help us facilitate
						conversations. This approach inevitably makes TwoFold ingenuine and goes aganist our mission.

					<h3>MVP</h3>
					<p>
						After another interation, we finalized our MVP, and here is the breakdown:
						<br />
						<br />
						PROFILE CARDS: Users will enter information into 25 profile cards. The high-level metadata will
						reflect users‚Äô value, interests and personality.
						<br />
						<br />
						MATCHING: Focus on finding people in the vicinity of their social and physical networks based on
						two criteria: shared interests and likelihood of organically meeting one another.
						<br />
						<br />
						GAMIFICATION SYSTEM: When users are first matched, all cards from both sides are hidden. As
						conversation goes on or touches upon any keyword, relevant profile cards are revealed.
						<br />
						<br />
						UNLOCK VIDEO CALL: When all cards are revealed for both parties, a video call feature is
						unlocked for both users. Users can also swap their avatars for profile pictures. This feature
						rewards users for authentic engagement.
						<br />
						<br />
						SUGGESTING FIRST DATE: After having their first video call, the app will suggest users to go on
						a first date. The algorithm will recommend a local event that align with users‚Äô mutual
						interests.
						<br />
						<br />
						BUSINESS MODEL: 1-6 month subscription. Everyone has an equal chance and monetization is not
						tied to giving people unfair advantage such as higher match ranking or visibility.
